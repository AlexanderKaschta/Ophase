				<!-- Hello! <br> <br>
				You want to start studying physics, geophysics, meteorology or teaching physics in Karlsruhe in the 2020/2021 winter semester? Then you are exactly right here! If not, you can find your O-phase under 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.asta-kit.de/o-phase"> www.asta-kit.de/o-phase. </a> <br><br>
				Regardless of this, you probably have a lot of questions: What lectures do I have to take? What is my schedule like? Which textbooks are recommended? How do I find the lecture halls, cafeteria, library, ...? Where are the best pubs in Karlsruhe? What else can you do at the university besides studying? <br>
				In order to make it easier for you to start your studies and to answer these questions, we organize an orientation phase for new students every winter semester. We would like to cordially invite you to the next O phase in the winter semester 2020/2021. It starts on Monday, October 26th, 2020 and ends on Friday, October 30th, 2020. <br><br>
				That begs the next question: Who are we actually? We are students ourselves who stand up for the interests of the students at the faculty. We also provide advice and information, such as this O-Phase, but also exam collections, examination protocols and much more. You can find out more about our work on our <a target="_blank" href="https://fachschaft.physik.kit.edu/drupal/"> website </a> or ... right: during the O-Phase . <br> <br>
				See you! <br>
				Your Greta and Alex <br> <br> -->
				Hello, <br><br>
				You want to start studying physics, geophysics, meteorology or teaching in Karlsruhe in the wintersemester
				2020/2021? Then you are exactly right here! If not, you can find your O-Phase <a href="https://www.asta-kit.de/o-phase">here</a>. <br> <br>

				In order to answer hopefully all of your questions and to make it easier for you to start your studies in general, every year we host a orientation phase for the new students. This year we are of course turning our entire concept upside down in order to	provide you with the most secure but nevertheless instructive and exciting O-Phase. In line with the motto of your first lectures, we have organized your first week at the KIT to be both, <span class="thick">digitally and in person</span>. That means	presence in small groups and digital lectures. In the lectures you will receive the most important information about	your studies while in your small groups questions will be answered and, most importantly, you will get to know	your future fellow students. <br><br>
				Sounds good! How can I participate? Just register <a href="<?= dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])?>/anmeldung">here</a> <span class="thick"> by October 19, 2020</span>. If you have urgent questions beforehand you may find the answers in our <a href="<?= dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])?>/anmeldung">FAQ</a>. 
				The O-Phase starts on <span class="thick"> Monday, October 26th, 2020</span> and lasts until <span class="thick"> Friday, October 30th, 2020</span>.
				When and where exactly you have to be on Monday, you will find out shortly before the start of the O-Phase.<br><br>

				That begs the next question: Who are we actually? We are students ourselves who stand up for the interests
				of the students at the faculty. We also provide advice and information, such as this O-Phase, but also
				exam collections, examination protocols and much more. You can find out more about our work on our <a class="right" href="https://fachschaft.physik.kit.edu/drupal/" target="_blank">website</a>	or. . . correct: during the O-Phase.  <br> <br>
				See you!<br>
